# openGL_block_shooter
learning openGL and networking in the local area network for multiplayer connections to a server

YOU'LL NEED PYTHON TO RUN THIS CODE:

THERE ARE 7 FILES YOU'LL NEED TO PUT INTO THE SAME DIR:
  3dtest.py
  game.py
  guns.py
  network.py
  server.py
  testlevel.txt
  texture.png
 
THE TEXTURE IMAGE IS FOR THE GEOMETRY SURFACES AND THE TESTLEVEL.TXT IS READ UPON THE GAME'S INITIATION.  A LIST OF BLOCK POSITIONS IN THE
WORLD IS GIVEN AND DRAWN AS BRICKS TO CREATE THE TEST LEVEL.  

THE GUNS.PY FILE IS WERE ALL THE GUN INFO IS GOING TO BE HELD, RIGHT NOW, IT ONLY CONTAINS THE PISTOL

SERVER.PY WILL, OF COURSE, NEED TO RUN ON A SEPERATE INSTANCE.  ON WINDOWS 10 I OPEN A POWERSHELL BY GOING TO THE DIR, CLICKING FILE AND
OPENING A POWERSHELL FROM THE DIR LOCATION.  REMEMBER THAT WITH POWERSHELL, UNLIKE CMD, YOU'LL HAVE TO CALL PYTHON BEFORE THE FILENAME TO
GET THE PROGRAM TO RUN.  
  -SERVER.PY WILL USE GAME.PY TO SET UP THE "GAME" CLASS USED TO PASS INFORMATION BETWEEN PLAYERS

3DTEST.PY IS THE CLIENT EACH PLAYER USES TO PLAY THE GAME.  THE BASE OF THIS PROGRAM WAS SUPPLIED USING github.com/fogleman/Minecraft.  
THANKS BE TO FOGLEMAN!!

3DTEST.PY WILL CREATE A "NET" OBJECT THROUGH THE NETWORK.PY FILE TO ESTABLISH A LINK TO THE SERVER

AS OF 8-14-2019:
  2 PLAYERS ARE ABLE TO CONNECT AND HAVE A PISTOL BATTLE, BOTH PLAYERS STILL FLY AND CAN PLACE BLOCKS LOCALY.  
  WHEN ONE PLAYER REACHES <1 HP THEIR IMAGE NO LONGER APPEARS ON OTHER PLAYER'S SCREENS, THE "DEAD" PLAYER'S GHOST IS STILL THERE
  CAN STILL BE DAMAGED BUT CANNOT FIRE BACK.  RESPAWN STILL NEEDS TO BE WRITTEN
  
  THE SERVER AND NETWORK BOTH HAVE TO BE MANUALLY CONFIGURED TO ESTABLISH A CONNECTION OVER THE LOCAL NETWORK VIA THE IP AND PORT
  VARIABLES
  
  WHEN ONE PLAYER LOGS ONTO THE SERVER AND SUBSIQUENTLY EXITS THE GAME, THE SERVER HAS NO PROBLEM CLOSING THE CUREENT GAME.  BUT THERE
  IS A PRBLEM WHEN TWO PLAYERS LOG ONTO THE SERVER AND ONE (OR BOTH) EXIT(S) THE GAME THE SERVER AND THE OTHER CLIENT LOCKS UP AND MUST
  BE RESTARTED  
  
          SO OUR CURRENT BACKLOG LOOKS LIKE:
                FIX PLAYER EXITING LOCKUP
                ALLOW MORE PLAYERS ON TO ONE GAME
                SEARCH LOCAL NETWORK FOR CURRENT GAMES
                MANIPULATE NETWORK IP AND PORT VARIABLES ONSCREEN INSTEAD OF IN SCRIPT
                IF NO CONNECTION EXISTS, RUN SERVER SCRIPT LOCALY
                CREATE RESPAWN AND SCOREBOARD
