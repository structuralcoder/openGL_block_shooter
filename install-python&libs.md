# HOW TO INSTALL PYTHON

## GETTING STARTED

---

#### THE FOLLOWING IS WORKING AS OF 8-15-19 ON WINDOWS

* GO TO python.org AND SELECT "DOWNLOADS" FROM THE TOP MENU
* JUST UNDER THE MENU, YOU SHOULD SEE A YELLOW BUTTON THAT SAYS SOMETHING LIKE "DOWNLOAD PYTHON 3.7.4" (OR WHATEVER THE LATEST VERSION IS)
* COMPLETE THE SETUP WIZARD AFTER THE DOWNLOAD COMPLETES 
* OPEN CMD (COMMAND PROMT), ON WINDOWS 10 JUST TYPE "CMD" INTO THE SEARCH BAR ON THE TASK BAR
* TYPE python INTO THE COMMAND LINE AND HIT **ENTER**, YOU SHOULD GET SOMETHING LIKE THIS:
```
C:\Users\*YOUR-NAME-HERE*>python
Python 3.7.3 (v3.7.3:ef4ec6ed12, Mar 25 2019, 21:26:53) [MSC v.1916 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

IF YOU DONT GET THE ABOVE INFORMATION, THEN YOUR COMPUTER IS HAVING TROUBLE FINDING YOUR NEWLY INSTALLED PYTHON PROGRAM.  YOU CAN HELP
YOUR COMPUTER BY EDITING YOUR *ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES* TO HELP YOUR COMPUTER FIND PYTHON.  IF YOU DIDNT HAVE ANY TROUBLE WITH THE DOWNLOAD
AND YOU GOT SOMETHING LIKE THE ABOVE CODE RETURNED FROM CMD THEN SKIP THE NEXT STEP

## EDITING YOUR ENVIRONMENT

---

  IF YOUR COMPUTER IS HAVING TROUBLE FINDING THE PROGRAM YOUR REQUESTING VIA *CMD* THEN WE HAVE TO "CARVE OUT A PATH" TO HELP THE 
  COMPUTER TO FIND WHAT IT NEEDS.  FIRST OPEN **FILE EXPLORER** EITHER BY TYPING IT OUT IN THE SEARCH BAR OR BY SELECTING THE FILE
  ON YOUR TASKBAR (IF YOU STILL SHOW A PICTURE OF A FILE ON YOUR TASKBAR).  ON THE LEFT PAN, NAVIGATE TO YOUR HARD DRIVE'S ROOT DIR.
  
  YOU CAN DO THIS BY SELECTING *THIS PC* (ON WINDOWS 10)(*MY COMPUTER* ON OTHER VERSIONS)  MOST OF THE TIME, YOUR HARD DRIVE IS
  LABELED C:\, BUT SOME PEOPLE MAY BE USING A D:\ DRIVE OR WHATEVER.  YOU'LL SEE SOME OF THE FOLLOWING FILES IN YOUR ROOT DIRECTORY:
  ```
  * DRIVERS
  * PROGRAM FILES
  * PROGRAM FILES(x86)
  * USERS
  * ETC...
  ```
